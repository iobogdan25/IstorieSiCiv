Thanks to all of you who’ve watched and responded to Humans of New York: The Series! If you haven’t had a chance to see it yet, today's episode is a great place to start. It’s all about relationships. Some of HONY’s greatest moments have come from couples. And the film version is no different. Hope you enjoy! Also, if you haven’t followed the show page yet, please do! We’re starting from scratch over there. But we’re a hearty group of pioneers and there’s plenty of land for everyone. So come join the colony!
